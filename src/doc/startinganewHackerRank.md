context is:
  I am opening a hacker rank exercise and converting into a unit test


0- initialize base files
  - copy/paste previous template
  - template is hr-<exercisename>.js and hr-<exercisename>.test.js
  - rename objects, declare function
  - update imports

1- open hackkerank and copy the challenge across 
    (Name appropriately)

2- identify inputs/outputs that show the function succeeded
  2.1- create matching unit tests
  2.2- identify intent of the work to be completed (that can be done when you are reading exercise first time)
  2.3- research google on how people solved a similar problem
  2.4- if copying:
          look for a code that attends your standards. Choose quality over familiarity
          keep references/links copied somewhere for future reference
        if making solution from scratch
          identify patterns
          keep references of implementatioins   
3- start debugger

4- implement hr test 

5- check tests output on terminal

6- don't ever stop running project. code is built as it runs.

7- fail fast, celebrate it. That is what coding is about. 1 Success is the result of 1000s of failures. You need failures
